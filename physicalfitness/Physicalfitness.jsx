              It produces changes in the parts of the brain that regulate stress
              and anxiety. It can also increase brain sensitivity to the
              hormones serotonin and norepinephrine, which relieve feelings of
              depression.
            </p>
            <p>
              Additionally, exercise can increase the production of endorphins,
              which are known to help produce positive feelings and reduce the
              perception of pain. Interestingly, it doesnâ€™t matter how intense
              your workout is. It seems that exercise can benefit your mood no
              matter the intensity of the physical activity.
