              and anxiety. It can also increase brain sensitivity to the
              hormones serotonin and norepinephrine, which relieve feelings of
              depression.
            </p>
            <p>
              Additionally, exercise can increase the production of endorphins,
              which are known to help produce positive feelings and reduce the
              perception of pain. Interestingly, it doesn’t matter how intense
              your workout is. It seems that exercise can benefit your mood no
              matter the intensity of the physical activity.
